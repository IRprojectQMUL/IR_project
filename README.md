# IR_project
This is the repository to be used where we can copy the main source code to allow us all to work on it individually. 

if you wanna add new code just add it the 'source code' file

 Also if you haven't used git hub before do the tutorial so you know what to do and how to do it tbh. Also when you've made changes to the main code ALWAYS MAKE A NEW BRANCH and before you commit the changes ask another member of the group to check it out if its like a big change if not change at will. Also do it on google colab cause easier tbh the code to download dataset from kaggle and to install elastic search provided as well
